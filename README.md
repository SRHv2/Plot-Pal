GenerativeAI project using LLMs, with a basic front end interface for easy use.
Student assistance chatbot for people studying Artificial Intelligence or Data Science. Stays on point and answers relevant questions. Capable of explaining concepts, writing code, retaining memory/context in current session only. 
Promotes learning instead of "vibecoding"(though if the user prefers that option is also available).
Made using Gemini Flash-2.5 API(LLM used for thiinking/processing), PyMuPDF(reading/parsing through PDFs) and StreamLit(frontend UI).
